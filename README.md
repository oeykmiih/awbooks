# awbooks-markdown

`awbooks-markdown` is a client side tool to create stylized PDF documents using Markdown, HTML and CSS.

it's inspired by [homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/) and stylized to resemble the book collection "Architectural Words" from Architectural Association London.

## installation

this needs to be addressed.

## usage

basic markdown language is supported/under way.

i've added a few more things in order to work faster on creating a book.

## notice

bear in mind I'm a novice in code in general and the main goal here to get used to it. any suggestions and tips are welcome!
