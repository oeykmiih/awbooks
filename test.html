<p>The site I was given was next to the Hyuga Residence and had a similar topography, being set on a cliff by the sea and accessed from a road on a higher level. I liked the descending approach. Walking down to a building is very different from walking up to one. A building on a higher level is seen against the sky; you have to look up at it and acknowledge its presence as an object. A building on a lower level, on the other hand, is difficult to see. In extreme cases, you may be right on top of it before you know.</p>
<p>Walking down to the Hyuga Residence, you come across a garden with a pleasant lawn that juts out towards the sea. Beneath this lawn is a narrow, dimly lit space containing an addition designed by Bruno Taut. There</p>
<p>is no outward hint of the existence of the space - the architecture is made to disappear, far more effectively than any conventional basement. Moreover, there is no lower vantage point from which you can look up at the building, so precipitously does the land rise from the sea. Nor does the access road on the upper level reveal its presence; from there all you see are the trees growing on the cliff. The Hyuga Residence is hidden from view from both higher and lower levels. It is doubly absent.</p>
<p>The conditions were the same in the project I call</p>
<p>'Water/Glass'. The building is visually shielded in nearly all directions. The only place from which its exterior is visible is the garden of the Hyuga Residence - a gesture made out of solidarity with, and as an act of homage to, Taut. To make a building without a display exterior, as such, the architect must relinquish the use of forms and abandon the idea of making an object. This does not mean character</p>

<p>to what had seemed to be an absence. Taut desribes not just the spaces of Katsura, but the time flowing through it.</p>

<blockquote>The path passing through the woods and leading to the tea-house [Shokatei] is a philosophical preparation. First there is a quiet pastoral, a murmuring stream and a small waterfall - from around this point, a serious transformation begins, with coarse stones, such as might be found on a windswept shore, the tip of a promontory ... The stern stones seem to command the visitor to rneditate. A rough stone bridge leads to the tea-house. The tea party is held without ceremony and with no regard for differences in social status, however, once the party sits down to a meal in the larger room, sounds of the waterfall are heard once more and for the first time one sees sunlight falling on the cascading water. A turtle that had been sunning itself on a rock in the middle of the pond sinks into the water with a splash. Fish swim up to the surface and reveal their scales, and cicadas sing delightful songs in the shade ... The world is truly beautiful.</blockquote>

<p>Taut also made sketches of Katsura. In an atttempt to capture time in a two-dimensional framework, he combines images in ink with signs such as arrows and lines of text. He draws them so that they overlap one another on the Japanese paper (washi). The overlapping is significant, for it suggests the layering of time. He also uses transparent lines and planes in light ink to record the course of movement. Brushstrokes, by their transition from heavy black to light black, indicate the passage of time. Chinese black ink (sumi) is a medium that can describe time in that way.  These sketches reflect a personal wrestling, on Taut's part, with the greatest difficulty confronting twentieth-century architecture and art as a whole - the integration of space and time.</p>
