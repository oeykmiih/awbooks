      <p>The site I was given was next to the Hyuga Residence and had a similar topography, being set on a cliff by the sea and accessed from a road on a higher level. I liked the descending approach. Walking down to a building is very different from walking up to one. A building on a higher level is seen against the sky; you have to look up at it and acknowledge its presence as an object. A building on a lower level, on the other hand, is difficult to see. In extreme cases, you may be right on top of it before you know. Walking down to the Hyuga Residence, you come across a garden with a pleasant lawn that juts out towards the sea. Beneath this lawn is a narrow, dimly lit space containing an addition designed by Bruno Taut. There is no outward hint of the existence of the space - the architecture is made to disappear, far more effectively than any conventional basement. Moreover, there is no lower vantage point from which you can look up at the building, so precipitously does the land rise from the sea. Nor does the access road on the upper level reveal its presence; from there all you see are the trees growing on the cliff. The Hyuga Residence is hidden from view from both higher and lower levels. It is doubly absent. The conditions were the same in the project I call 'Water/Glass'. The building is visually shielded in nearly all directions. The only place from which its exterior is visible is the garden of the Hyuga Residence - a gesture made out of solidarity with, and as an act of homage to, Taut.To make a building without a display exterior, as such, the architect must relinquish the use of forms and abandon the idea of making an object.
